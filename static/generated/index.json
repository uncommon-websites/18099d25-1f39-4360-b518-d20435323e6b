    "prompt": "A group of confident homeowners, aged 35-55, stand calmly and proudly in front of a modern, well-maintained home with sleek solar panels on the roof. The scene is shot in a cool, slightly overcast natural light, with crisp detail and a slight desaturation. The environment is a realistic, accessible suburban neighborhood, with clean driveways and muted landscaping. The composition uses an editorial documentary style, with a medium-wide, eye-level perspective that shows both the homeowners and their home in context. The homeowners’ posture and expressions convey calm confidence and clarity, without staged smiles or forced gestures. The image has clear negative space in the sky and architectural lines, with subtle blues and cool grays in the color palette, emphasizing clarity, coordination, and professional accomplishment.",
